I decided to create a Bank Management System. The goal was to create a basic application
that mimics the core functionalities of a traditional bank. Customers could sign up and create
accounts, then log in to perform transactions like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers
between their accounts. The system would also provide them with an overview of their
current available balance.

This project served as a benchmark to apply what we have learned in the classes and in the
assignments about Java concepts and apply them in a practical scenario. It aimed to simulate
a real-world banking system's essential operations and user interactions. While this was a
basic version, it provided a foundation for understanding how to build such an application
and the core functionalities involved.

Instructions on opening this java application.

When you first open he application, you get to see the starting interface of the applicationa.
When you open this banking application, you are sent to a login page, where you can log in
through the Customer ID and PIN that you created either while signing up or the Bank
manager provided you both things if he helped with account creation.
If you are a new user and do not have an account with this bank, then, you can open a new
account by clicking on Sign Up.

When you click on Sign up, a pop up appears where the application requires some details to
create the account, the details are then saved in the file and you are also given the new bank
account number from the bank that you need to save to use for future.

After that you need to login with the information, after logging in from the new credentials,
you will be directed to the main page of the banking application.

On the main Page user can then do whatever they want, just for instance, if the customer
wants to deposit some funds into this account, he can do that by click on Deposit Funds.

You can add the funds you want and then click on the deposit, do keep in mind that you need
to put in your own account number from which you have logged in, if you use another then it
will prompt an message for using your own account only.

After this customer (you) can view these funds that you added on Display Funds on the main
page.


After you click on Display Funds, you as customer are asked to put in your account number
to view your funds.

So now your funds will be displayed to you, and similarly if you put in wrong or another
account you will be prompted as error message asking you to put in correct account number.
After that you can also Withdraw these funds from Withdraw Funds option and you can also
send money from your account to another account using Transfer Funds option on the main
oage.
